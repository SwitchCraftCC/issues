# SwitchCraft 3 Issue Tracker

# THIS TRACKER IS NOT FOR REPORTING EXPLOITS.

Any bug found that has any potential to be exploited by other players, e.g. duplication bugs, spam bugs, claim bypass 
bugs, should be **silently** and **responsibly** disclosed **to a member of staff** and NOT shown/told to ANY other 
players while they are unpatched. Irresponsible disclosure of exploits may lead to an immediate mute or ban.

For more information on the rules regarding exploits, see [Rule 3](https://docs.sc3.io/rules.html#r3).
