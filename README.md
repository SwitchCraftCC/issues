## Reporting exploits

Any bug found that has any potential to be exploited by other players, e.g. duplication bugs, spam bugs, claim bypass
bugs, should be **silently** and **responsibly** disclosed **to a member of staff** (see below for links) and NOT
shown/told to ANY other players while they are unpatched. Irresponsible disclosure of exploits may lead to an immediate
mute or ban (see [Rule 3](https://docs.sc3.io/rules.html#r3)). **If you are unsure whether a bug is an exploit, please
ask a member of staff first.**

If you do find an exploit, you may be eligible for at least **500 KST** bug bounty reward. This reward will be paid out 
to you once the exploit has been fixed and the fix has been deployed to the server. It is up to the discretion of the
staff team whether you will be eligible for the reward, and how much.

### How to report an exploit

The following methods are responsible ways to report an exploit:

- [Google Forms](https://exploit.sc3.io) (**recommended**)
- In-game: Privately `/msg` an online member of staff. Make sure that they actually receive and respond to your message.
- Discord: Send a direct message to a member of staff. Not all members of staff have DMs enabled.
- Email: Send an email to: ![mail hidden](https://i.imgur.com/6ueZZpH.png). This email address is monitored by staff.

### What counts as an exploit?

An exploit is a bug that has the potential to be abused by other players. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Server crashes or denial of service bugs
- Item or resource duplication bugs
- Claim bypass bugs (ClaimKit)
- KristPay bugs (e.g. stealing money)
- Krist bugs (e.g. stealing Krist)

**If you are ever in any doubt, privately talk to a member of staff first!**
